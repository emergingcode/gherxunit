# ðŸš€ GherXUnit: An Alternative for BDD with xUnit
[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs](README_PTBR.md) | [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English Version](README.md)

The adoption of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has become increasingly common in software development, promoting better communication between technical and non-technical teams. However, its integration with traditional testing frameworks is not always straightforward.

**GherXunit** emerges as a viable alternative for teams looking to explore the benefits of BDD within the xUnit framework, without requiring external tools such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> According to the study *Behavior Driven Development: A Systematic Literature Review* (Farooq et al., 2023, IEEE Access), some recurring difficulties in using BDD include:
> - â›”ï¸Ž **Complex automation**: Integration with external tools can increase configuration and test execution complexity.
> - â›”ï¸Ž **Difficult maintenance**: As the test base grows, Gherkin scenarios can become hard to manage.
> - â›”ï¸Ž **Learning curve**: The need to master new tools can hinder BDD adoption, especially in teams already familiar with traditional frameworks.

### âœ… Where Can GherXunit Help?

**GherXunit** aims to offer an alternative for teams already using xUnit and looking to incorporate the BDD structure without completely changing their tools. Among its benefits are:

- âœ” **Using Gherkin syntax directly in xUnit**, reducing external dependencies.
- âœ” **More modular and organized code**, using partial classes to separate scenarios and steps.
- âœ” **Better integration with unit tests**, allowing a smoother transition between different levels of testing.

### ðŸ’¡ How Does It Work?

The core idea of **GherXunit** is to allow test scenarios to be written in a structure familiar to those already using xUnit.

#### ðŸ“Œ Example of Step Implementation:

> [!TIP]  
> In this example, the `SubscriptionTest` class is split into two files. The first file defines the test scenarios, while the second file defines the step methods. Using `partial` allows both files to contribute to the definition of the same `SubscriptionTest` class.

The result of running the test scenarios defined in the `SubscriptionTest` class would be similar to the following output:

</p>


See more usage examples and implementation details for `Background`, `Rule`, `Features`, and other elements in the [sample code](/src/sample/BddSample/Samples) available in the **GherXunit** repository.

### ðŸ”Ž Is GherXunit for You?

If your team already uses xUnit and wants to experiment with a BDD approach without drastically changing its workflow, **GherXunit** may be an option to consider. It does not eliminate all BDD challenges but seeks to facilitate its adoption in environments where xUnit is already widely used.
